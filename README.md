### Overview

In this Notebook, we will cover the following steps:

1.	Define a Function that Makes a Graph: Create a function to visualize stock data.
2.	Extract Stock Data Using yfinance: Use the yfinance library to pull stock data.
3.	Webscraping Tesla Revenue Data: Scrape revenue data for Tesla.
4.	Extract More Stock Data Using yfinance: Retrieve additional stock data.
